<h1><br /> Call for Papers</h1>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the application of graphs in different domains. They have been widely used for data modeling of different application domains such as multimedia databases, protein networks, social networks and semantic web. With the continued emergence and increase of massive and complex structural graph data, a graph database that efficiently supports elementary data management mechanisms is crucially required to effectively understand and utilize any collection of graphs.
</p>
<p>
  The overall goal of the workshop is to bring people from different fields together, exchange research ideas and results, and encourage discussion about how to provide efficient graph data management techniques in different application domains and to understand the research challenges of such area. The first international workshop on graph data management and analysis (GDMA 2017) was held in Beijing, China in conjunction with APWeb-WAIM 2017 and GDMA 2018-2023 was held in conjunction with DASFAA 2018-2023, respectively. The theme of GDMA 2024 is “Graph Management and Analysis with LLMs”. Having the workshop collocated with DASFAA as a leading database conference will definitely help to achieve the main goals of the workshop.
<p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>	Storing graph data.</li>
<li>	Indexing graph data.</li>
<li>	Supporting different types of graph queries.</li>
<li>	Estimating the selectivity of graph queries.</li>
<li>	Graph mining.</li>
<li>	Graph learning.</li>
<li>	Compact (compressed) representation of graph data.</li>
<li>	Measuring graph similarity.</li>
<li>	Graph query languages.</li>
<li>	Graph question answering.</li>
<li>	Graph data management for social network applications.</li>
<li>	Graph data management of multimedia databases.</li>
<li>	Graph data management of semantic web data.</li>
<li>	Graph data management for geometrical applications.</li>
<li>	Graph data management for business process management applications.</li>
<li>	Graph data management with LLMs.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>All papers must be submitted through EasyChair system, via the following link. The submission site is now open.</p>
<p>The conference proceedings, including all accepted papers, will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and indexed by both EI and DBLP. Authors should avoid the use of non-English fonts to avoid problems with printing and viewing the submissions. All accepted papers MUST follow strictly the instructions for LNCS Authors. Springer LNCS site offers style files and information: <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0</a>.</p>
<p>Submissions must be original (not previously published and not under review in other forums). This applies to papers on all tracks of the conference. Authors are advised to interpret these limitations strictly and to contact the PC chairs in case of doubt. Each accepted paper must be accompanied by at least one full registration, and an author is expected to present the paper at the conference, otherwise, the paper will be removed from the proceedings and the LNCS digital library.</p>
<p>The review process is single-blinded. There is no need for authors to mask their names and affiliations in the manuscript. The maximal length of the paper is 16 pages.</p>
